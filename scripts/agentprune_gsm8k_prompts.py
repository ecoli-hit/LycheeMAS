Q: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. 
They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. 
They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. 
If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, 
include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day? (Hint: The answer is near to 4).

A: We know the Answer Hints: 4. With the Answer Hints: 4, we will answer the question. 
Let's think step by step. 
Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total.
For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total.
Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.
However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, 
so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.
They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.
And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.
So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total.
They want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75
They will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.
The answer is 4

Q: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles? (Hint: The answer is near to 160,145).
A: We know the Answer Hints: 160, 145. With the Answer Hints: 160, 145, we will answer the question.
Let's think step by step
When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she'll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 = 24
The total number of marbles she'll have is 60+24 = 84
If Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 = 30 frisbees.
If Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she'll have 2/5*30 = 12 more frisbees.
The total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+12 = 42
Bella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = 10 deck cards
If she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she'll have 2/5*10 = 4 more deck cards.
The total number of deck cards she'll have is 10+4 = 14
Together, Bella will have a total of 14+42+84 = 140 items
The answer is 140

Q: Susy goes to a large school with 800 students, while Sarah goes to a smaller school with only 300 students.  At the start of the school year, Susy had 100 social media followers.  She gained 40 new followers in the first week of the school year, half that in the second week, and half of that in the third week.  Sarah only had 50 social media followers at the start of the year, but she gained 90 new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week.  After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have? (Hint: The answer is near to 180, 160).
A: We know the Answer Hints: 180, 160. With the Answer Hints: 180, 160, we will answer the question.
Let's think step by step
After one week, Susy has 100+40 = 140 followers.
In the second week, Susy gains 40/2 = 20 new followers.
In the third week, Susy gains 20/2 = 10 new followers.
In total, Susy finishes the three weeks with 140+20+10 = 170 total followers.
After one week, Sarah has 50+90 = 140 followers.
After the second week, Sarah gains 90/3 = 30 followers.
After the third week, Sarah gains 30/3 = 10 followers.
So, Sarah finishes the three weeks with 140+30+10 = 180 total followers.
Thus, Sarah is the girl with the most total followers with a total of 180.
The answer is 180

Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today? 
A: ## Problem solving process analysis

There are {ori_tree_num} trees originally.
Then there were {after_planted_tree_num} trees after some more were planted.
So the number of trees planted today {today_planted_num} is the number of trees after planting {after_planted_tree_num} minus the number of trees before planting {ori_tree_num}.
The answer is {today_planted_num} = {after_planted_tree_num} - {ori_tree_num}.

## Actual analysis and solution process

In this question, {ori_tree_num} = 15 and {after_planted_tree_num} = 21.
There are 15 trees originally. 
Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted. 
So the number of trees planted today must have been 21 - 15 = 6.
The answer is 6

Q: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?
A:## Problem solving process analysis

Originally, Leah had {Leah_num} Leah_num chocolates.
Her sister had {sister_num} chocolates.
So in total they had {all_num} = {Leah_num} + {sister_num} chocolates.
After eating {eating_num} chocolates, the number of chocolates they have left {remain_num} is {all_num} minus {eating_num}. 
The answer is {remain_num} = {all_num} - {eating_num}.

## Actual analysis and solution process

In this question, {Leah_num} = 32, {sister_num} = 42 and {all_num} = 35.
So, in total they had 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates originally.
After eating 35 chocolates, they had 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates.
The answer is 39

DECISION_FEW_SHOT = "\nQ:Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?\n\nA:After reviewing the analysis and results provided by the other agents, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the interpretation of the problem. The key point of contention is the base value on which the 150% increase is calculated.\n\nAgents 623T, 8GTW, and 7R9w have calculated the 150% increase based on the total investment (purchase price + repair costs), which is $130,000. They have then added this increase to the total investment to find the new value of the house, and subsequently calculated the profit by subtracting the total investment from the new value of the house. This approach leads to a profit calculation of $195,000.\n\nAgent 3qfQ, however, has interpreted the problem differently. This agent suggests that the 150% increase should be calculated based on the initial purchase price only, not the total investment. Following this method, the increased value is calculated as $80,000 (initial purchase price) + ($80,000 * 1.5), which equals $200,000. The profit is then calculated by subtracting the total investment ($130,000) from this increased value, resulting in a profit of $70,000.\n\nThe problem statement is ambiguous because it does not explicitly state whether the 150% increase is based on the initial purchase price alone or the total investment. However, the most common interpretation in real estate when referring to an increase in value due to repairs would be based on the initial purchase price, as the value increase is typically a reflection of the property's market value appreciation, not the sum of costs incurred.\n\nTherefore, based on the typical real estate valuation practice and the more common interpretation of such scenarios, Agent 3qfQ's approach seems to be the most reliable. The profit should be calculated based on the increased value from the initial purchase price, not the total investment.\n\nThe final result, based on the most reliable interpretation, is a profit of $70,000.\n\nThe answer is 70000\n"
